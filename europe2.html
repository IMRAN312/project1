        <figcaption class="details1">Congress avoids government shutdown in last-minute deal
            The US government has avoided a federal shutdown after both House and Senate agreed on a short-term funding deal.
            
            A bill ensuring funding until 17 November received overwhelming support, and was signed into law by
             President Joe Biden minutes before a deadline.
            
            However, it excludes any new aid for Ukraine in a blow for Democrats, for whom this was a key demand.
            
            Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy submitted the bill in defiance of hard-liners in his own party.
            
            A government shutdown, which would place tens of thousands of federal employees on furlough without pay 
            and suspend various government services, was slated to begin at 00:01 ET (04:01 GMT) on Sunday.
            But in a dramatic turnaround on Saturday afternoon, Mr McCarthy decided to put to a vote the temporary 
            funding measure that would keep the government open.
            
            The measure contains funding for natural disasters but makes no major concessions on spending levels -
             a key demand of the Republicans controlling the lower house.
            
            A majority of lawmakers were keen to avert a shutdown, and the bill was backed by more Democrats than Republicans, 
            with as many as 90 House Republicans voting against it.
            
            The move was a blow to a small group of right-wing Republicans who have held up negotiations in the chamber
             with unyielding demands for spending cuts and no new aid for Ukraine.
            
            And with the House adjourning immediately after the vote, the Senate which had agreed its own bill that
             included aid for Ukraine was left with no choice but to pick up the House legislation. Only nine senators
             voted against - all Republican.
