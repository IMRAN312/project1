    New York City and its adjoining areas have been brought to a standstill after a bout of torrential
    downpours triggered flash flooding, disrupting subway service, inundating ground-level apartments and delaying flights.
   
   Authorities declared a state of emergency and warned people to remain indoors as almost eight inches (20cm) 
   of rain fell in some parts of the most populous city in the US. Another few inches could fall in the region 
   before the storm system pushed out to sea later on Friday, forecasters said.
   
   New York Governor Kathy Hochul warned of “life-threatening” floods and declared a state of emergency for
    New York City, Long Island, and the Hudson Valley. Some national guard troops were deployed to assist in the response.
   
   In Mamaroneck, a Westchester County suburb north of the city, emergency officials used inflatable rafts
    to rescue people trapped in buildings by floods.
   
   Flooding caused major disruptions to New York’s subway system and the Metro North commuter rail service,
    according to the Metropolitan Transportation Agency, which operates both. Some subway lines were suspended entirely,
    and many stations were closed. Flights at LaGuardia Airport were also delayed due to the rains. Some bus routes
    slowed to a crawl, trapping riders for hours.Officials warned some New Yorkers to avoid 
   travelling unless they were fleeing a flooded area.
   
   Systems producing intense rainfalls such as Friday’s have become more common
    in many parts of the US, including the New York City area.
