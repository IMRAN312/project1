        Two Mexican migrants have been shot to death on the Mexican side of the border with the United States,
        Mexico’s National Migration Institute said.
       
       The incident occurred in the early hours of Friday morning.
        Another three people suffered gunshot wounds but were assisted by one of the 
       institute’s emergency rescue teams, along with nine others who were not injured.
       Rescue services found the group of 14 Mexican nationals at dawn on Cuchuma Hill near Tecate,
        a city in the border state of Baja California. By the time rescuers climbed up to meet the group,
        two migrants were already dead.
       The harsh desert hill is considered a sacred site by at least one Mexican Indigenous group,
        but it is also used by human smugglers.
       
       The cause of the shooting is not known, but border crossings in certain regions can involve 
       agreements with local cartels for the right of passage. Migrants and asylum seekers are sometimes 
       shot if their smuggler is working for a rival gang or if they haven’t paid passage rights.
       
       Migrants and asylum seekers are also often robbed by roving gangs of thieves and kidnappers in border areas.
