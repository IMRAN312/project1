            Ukrainian forces have been widening their breach of Russian defensive lines near the village 
            of Robotyne for several weeks and analysts say they may be preparing for a new push.
            
            The tiny village, some 56km (35 miles) south-east of the city of Zaporizhzhia,
             has been a focal point since Ukraine's counter-offensive began at the start of June.
            
            Progress has been slow but analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW)
             say they have confirmed that Ukrainian forces are operating armoured vehicles beyond the 
            Russian anti-tank ditch and dragon's teeth obstacles in the area for the first time
             - just to the west of nearby Verbove.
            The ISW describes this as an "important sign of progress" but adds it is not prepared 
            to say that Ukraine has broken through 
            as its forces have not breached the last visible defensive positions.
            
            BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says this is the most strategically important part
             of the Ukrainian counter-offensive and, if it is successful, could cut off Russia's supply 
            lines that connect the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don to Crimea.
            
            Doing so would make it all but impossible for Russia to maintain its huge garrison in Crimea,
             which it annexed in 2014, he adds.
