            Months into a ruinous war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF),
            many Sudanese people have been surprisingly less than welcoming about the re-emergence of the
            civilian coalition that was part of the country’s 2019 revolution.
           In July, one of the leaders of that civilian movement, former Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok,
            appeared at a regional summit, after two years of absence from the political scene.
           Despite the war in the country, the re-emergence of figures like Hamdok and the Forces
            for Freedom and Change (FFC) a coalition of parties, unions and civil society organisations
            that the former prime minister led a government with, is seen as opportunistic by many who still
            remember that the civilian coalition was overthrown in 2021.
           
           “The same faces that disappeared and were silent after the October coup
            are now lined up in front of foreign diplomats to present themselves as
            representatives of the Sudanese people,” said Qusai, a 28-year-old pharmacist living in Khartoum.</article>
